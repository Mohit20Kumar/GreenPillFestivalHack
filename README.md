# GreenPillFestivalHack - Repo
This Repository Contains the Source Code of The Project FOODPUNK
An ecosystem of restaurants, people and NGO workers (volunteers for distributing food) as a ReFi application.

# Problem Statement
India ranks 107, Out of 121 countries, the level of hunger and undernutrition in the country is now at “serious” levels, by Global Hunger Index
Children are especially vulnerable to the hunger crisis, with high rates of malnutrition and stunted growth, which will have long-term impacts on their health and well-being.
The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the hunger crisis in India, leading to loss of jobs and income, and disrupting food supply chains.

# Proposed Solution
To build an ecosystem of restaurants, people and NGO workers (volunteers for distributing food) as a ReFi application.
To get surplus food from restaurants and the community to serve less fortunate people.
For example, restaurants in the neighborhood Green Park, will contribute to the homeless of the locality, through volunteers who live in Green Park. These volunteers are largely students and young working professionals – everyone does this in their free time. The lesser fortunate sections of society we serve include homeless families, orphanages, patients from public hospitals, and old age homes.
This solution not only solves the hunger crisis but also tackles the food loss. 


# Implementation
The restaurant manager/community donations will notify the food to be distributed. 
Interested volunteers will contact the manager.
With the help of an IOT powered weighing machine, the details of food will be put on chain.(storage)
With proof of location the entire commute will be tracked and the area to which the food was given to.
When the food pack is accepted by someone(within geofence, as some sections of cities will be marked as poor) he/she has to sign a receive transaction.
This way the incentive will be divided between the restaurant and the volunteer.
